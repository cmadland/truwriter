## What is this?

This Wordpress Theme powers [TRU Writer](http://splot.ca/writer/); a site that allows people to publish their writing, including rich media content, without needing to login or understand the backend of Wordpress. 

Once installed the TRU Writer theme allows individuals to generate content online using an rich text editor interface. Writers can also add content by cutting and then pasting into the editor from word-processing software such as MS Word or Google Docs, carrying forward most structural formatting (here's an example of a post [created by using the copy/paste function (cmd/ctrl + V) from a Word document](http://splot.ca/writer/2014/101). 

Because it requires no login or CMS knowledge, TRU writer is great for projects where multiple people are contributing or for classroom applications where many individuals need to publish content on the same site. It focuses on the writing rather than Wordpress (not that we do not love you, Wordpress!)

The site invisibly logs in visitors to a special account to make available advanced publication and editing tools, but those individuals will not need to navigate the Wordpress dashboard or login structure (we love dashboards, but hey, not everyone needs to see that mess, right?). The TRU Writer allows individuals to publish anonymously, or under an assumed name, or their own name, or whatever. 

The TRU Writer Theme was developed along with the [TRU Collector](http://splot.ca/splots/the-comparator/), the [TRU Sounder](http://splot.ca/splots/tru-sounder/), [The Comparator](http://splot.ca/splots/the-comparator/), and the [Daily Blank](http://splot.ca/splots/the-daily-blank/) [while on a fellowship](http://cogdog.trubox.ca) at [Thompson Rivers University](http://tru.ca/)--that's why the "TRU" in the theme name.

## With Thanks

SPLOTs have no venture capital, no IPOs, no real funding at all. But they have been helped along by a few groups worth recognizing with an icon and a link.

The original TRU Writer was developed under a [Thompson Rivers University Open Learning Fellowship](http://cogdog.trubox.ca/) and further development was supported in part by a [Reclaim Hosting Fellowship](http://reclaimhosting.com), an [OpenETC grant](https://opened.ca), and ongoing support by [Patreon patrons](https://patreon.com/cogdog).

## Installing From Reclaim Hosting

If you are wise enough to host your web sites at [Reclaim Hosting](http://reclaimhosting.com/) you have the option of installing a fully functioning site with this theme ([a copy of the demo site](http://lab.cogdogblog.com/writer/)) including recommended plugins, configured settings and sample content, all done  in one click. *But wait there is more!* With this method of installing your site, future updates to the theme are automatically added to your site.

In your cpanel, under **Applications** go to **All Applications**. This theme is available listed under Fratured Applications; just install from there.

![](images/reclaim-featured.jpg "Reclaim Hosting Featured Applications")

*Note that unlike other WordPress installs, this one will not preserve your username/password, so be sure to save that information.* When it's done, log into your new site and start making it your own. 

### Installing TRU Writer from Scratch

Using this theme requires a self-hosted--or institutionally hosted (lucky you)-- Wordpress site (the kind that you download from [wordpress.org](http://www.wordpress.org). You cannot use this theme on the free "wordpress.com" site. Maybe check out [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/) if you need to set up your own hosting space. 

The TRU Writer is a child theme based on [the free and elegant Radcliffe theme by Anders Noren](https://wordpress.org/themes/radcliffe). Install this theme first from within the Wordpress Dashboard under **Appearance** -- **Themes** searching on `Radcliffe`.

Download the TRU Writer theme (use the green **Clone or Download** button above) as a ZIP file.

The zip can be uploaded directly to your site via **Add Themes** in the Wordpress dashboard. Of you run into size upload limits or just prefer going old school like me, unzip the package and ftp the entire folder into your `wp-content/themes` directory.

To get the TRU Writer working all you need to do is activate the "TRU Writer" theme when it appears in your Wordpress dashboard under **Appearance** --> **Themes**. 

### Updating the TRU Writer Theme (manually)

*Note (Dec 11, 2018) If your site's featured images are blank, it's likely because of a change to the parent Radcliffe theme that was automatically updated on your site. An update to TRU Writer version 1.2 or later will fix this issue.*

If you have ftp/sftp access to your site (or this can be done in a cpanel file manager), simply upload the new theme files to the `wp-content/themes` directory that includes the older version theme. 

For those that lack direct file upload access or maybe that idea sends shivers down the spine, upload and activate the [Easy Theme and Plugin Upgrades](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-theme-and-plugin-upgrades/) plugin -- this will allow you to upload a newer version of a theme as a ZIP archive, the same way you add a theme by uploading.

## Setting Up TRU Writer

Now that you've installed TRU Writer and can see the barebones theme staring back at you. It is not very interesting. Yet.

### Recommended Plugins for TRU Writer

*Note: The newest versions of this theme present dashboard notifications for suggested plugins and one click links to install and/or activate.*

While your doing all that uploading, you should know that this theme uses the [Reading Time WP plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/reading-time-wp/) to insert those commonplace estimates of reading time -- blame [Medium](http://www.medium.com) if you hate knowing how long a post might take to read.

Also install and activate the [Remove Dashboard Access plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/remove-dashboard-access-for-non-admins/). This plugin this keeps anyone logged in as the secret user from even seeing the Wordpress dashboard. It also stops someone who is leaving a comment from getting inside the secret user profile and changing your "writer" password, which blows everything up. This plugin is not critical for the Writer to work, it just closes the back door a bit tighter.

In the settings for Remove Dashboard Access plugin, restrict access to **Editors and Administrators** or just **Administrators** depending if you will have a moderator user. The default redirect should be for the main URL of the site.

![Remove Dashboard Access settings](images/dashboard-access-settings.jpg "Remove Dashboard Access settings")

## Demo Content

If you want a site that is not completely empty, you can get one with the content set up on the [public demo site](https://lab.cogdogblog.com/writer). 

Install all content by [downloading the WordPress export for that site](https://github.com/cogdog/truwriter/blob/master/data/truwriter.xml).  Running the WordPress Importer (under **Tools** -- **Import**) and upload that file when prompted.

You can also get a copy of the Widgets used on that site too. First intall/activate the [Widget Importer & Exporter plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/). Download the [Writer Widgets data file](https://github.com/cogdog/truwriter/blob/master/data/writer-widgets.wie). Look under the **Tools** menu for **[Widget Importer & Exporter** and use the Import Widgets section to upload the data file. Boom! You got Widgets.


### Page Setup
This theme has several pages that must be created; each is associated with a specific template that provide it's functionality. Activating the theme *should* create these all for you when the theme is activated, but if not, create them as described below. You can edit the content of the **Write** and **Desk** pages to customize the prompt seen by writers on your site.

If the theme does not do so automatically (and it should) create these Wordpress **Pages**. You can modify the titles, and add whatever content you want to appear at the top as instructions, but do not change the slug or short name.

* **Write** -- The page that provides the writing form see [http://splot.ca/writer/write](http://splot.ca/writer/write). You can title it whatever you like, but the slug (url name) must be `write`  Whatever you include in the body (not required) is added to the top of the form, maybe for extra instructions.e.g. for a site at `http://coolest.site.org/` the page must be published at `http://coolest.site.org/write`

* **Desk** -- The page that provides users will see first if they must enter an access code to access the writing tool (see below). If no access code is required, it redirects to the page above for the writing form-- like  [http://splot.ca/writer/desk](http://splot.ca/writer/desk). You can title it whatever you like, but the slug (url name) must be `desk` Whatever you include in the body (not required) is added to the top of the form, maybe for a friendly prompt .e.g. for a site at `http://coolest.site.org/` the page must be published at `http://coolest.site.org/desk`


### Customize Your Menus

The default menus are not what you want (it will add menu items for some pages that users should not see! Wordpress will generate one based on all Pages set up.

![](images/default-menus.jpg)

In Wordpress Dashboard go to Appearance -&gt; Menus. Create a new menu, and check the location box for "Primary". A typical TRu Writer menu might have an "About Page", the Write page (the form for writing), maybe a Random link, and a set of dropdowns to see pages by category. Here is one example for the site http://splot.ca/Writer

![](images/writer-menus.jpg)

You can of course, create any menu structure that works for your site- but don't use the default! And hey, if you're being all fancy and don't check the "Primary" box above, remember to go into the "Manage Menus" tab and change it from the default menu to the new awesome menu you just created or all you'll see is the default menu popping up again and again and that will be frustrating.  It will list as menu items a bunch of pages that users never should see (e.g. Welcome Desk, Get Edit Link).

### Theme Options and Settings
Upon activation the theme will set up a **TRU Writer Options** link that appears in the black admin bar at the top of your Wordpress Dashboard interface (when logged in), and in the "Appearance" tab on your Wordpress Dashboard. 

Click **TRU Writer Options** to see or change the settings outlined below. 
    
*(For extra fun "writer" from here on, in lower case, refers to the person using your site; the person who comes and wants to write something on your awesome Writer site.)*

In the TRU Writer Theme, traditional "posts" in Wordpress are renamed "writings," but they still have all the attributes of garden variety Wordpress blog posts. Yum.


#### Access Options

![](images/access-options.jpg)

Leave this field blank if you want any visitor to be able to access the writing form on your TRU Writer site. If that's too open for you, add a code and give it a hint. If you want a quick workaround here, make the site less accessible by not having any links in the homepage menu bar that go to the editor page--no link to the "writer" page, the harder it is to find the editor and post something.  

If you want to require users to enter an access code (a very weak password), just enter it in the space provided. Any requests to access the editor and write a post will be sent to a front-page where a writer must enter the passcode. As an example, we have "Lassie" and an equally difficult hint. If you enter in "Lassie," you can see the editor and begin the process of writing a post--but don't actually do that; we haven't set everything up yet! This is a hypothetical situation. For now, decide if you want a passcode. If you do, put it in, with a hint. If you don't, moving on!

The TRU Writer is a moderated publishing theme. And "moderated" means that when a writer submits something, it is not  immediately visible to the world. Instead, unless you set it otherwise (more on that below), when a writer submits a post (or "writing" as above) they are automatically set as drafts with a  *Pending Approval* status. You'll get notifications that a submissions has been made to the Email address you enter in the "Notifications Email" option. 

In order to make a post (or "writing" as above) visible, a user with the permission status of "Editor" or "Administrator" needs to change the status of the "pending approval" writing to "published (or ignore an "Editor" or "Administrator" could just ignore it forever, such power is theirs).

#### Publish Options

![](images/publish-options1.jpg)

You can also choose the "status for new writings" as "publish immediately" and there are no checks and balances--the writing goes right up and is publicly visible immediately. Immediate gratification goes a long way. Note though, that because of the hollow tunnel this might create, this option works best with an access code as described above in place--right Lassie!?

Enter the **Default Writing Prompt** field to pre-populate the field that visitors write use to compose their work. You can provide a prompt or set up a structure. The editor is now full rich text enabled (including images).


![](images/publish-options2.jpg)

Check the **Allow Comments** box to add a standard blog comment field at the bottom of all published pieces. 


On the editor where people will be composing their madness, the **Extra Information Field** represents a place for them to add extra information that is not part of the final published item, but that the administrator or editor might need to know, or might have requested. As an example, if you are using this theme to host multiple sections of a class or course of study, you might want to populate the prompt for this field with something like "Include your name and course section" or, "name the dog that best represents you" or "tell me why your writing is so late."

These end up in a **Custom Field** named "wEditorNotes," which you can view when editing the post in order to publish it (not the "quick edit"; the full monty "edit" please). You will need to open the Screen Options toggle at the top of the Wordpress Dashboard interface and click the box that makes the Custom Fields available. The information is also included in the notification emails announcing a new writing in need of approval.

Under **Default Header Image** click **Set/Change Image** to open the Wordpress media editor to choose a default media header image. Drop an image that you wish to be used as a default one if a writer does not include one of their own. The `640 x 300` dimensions are a minimum size, and represent a reasonable aspect ratio for a header image. Larger is better; and the image will be cropped along the middle of the image.

![](images/header-image-caption.jpg)

Before choosing the image, be sure to add a caption (we suggest a creative commons license!) as this is what is used to display atop the image when published. Attribute and model attribution! FTW!

![](images/header-image-selected.jpg)

Once selected you will see a preview of your default image. Isn't Cadu a nice looking dog?


![](images/publish-options3.jpg)

Disable **Show the categories menu on writing form and display** if you do not want writers or readers to use/see categories.

If you have not set up any categories, the **Default Category for New Writing** menu will not do much. You might want to save your options and go edit your **Writing Categories**. On activation the TRU Writer will pre-create two categories it uses to organize what is submitted and published.

![](images/categories.jpg)

The `In Progress` category is where all submitted writings go if they need approval. Final Published items have their own ... `Published` category (big surprise there, eh?). If you want to give your writers a choice of categories to place their work, make sure any categories you create have `Published` as a parent.

![](images/categories-published.jpg)

So we suggest making a few pre-set categories for a new site. As an Administrator you can always add new ones at any time. Any text you add as a description will be included on the writing form.

Disable **Show the tags entry on writing form and single items displays?** if you do not want writers or readers to use/see tags. Likewise use **Show the footer entry field on the writing form?** to use/disable the footer field writers can append to their works.

Enter in **Notification Emails** any email addresses who should be notified if new submissions; you have multiple ones if you separate them by a comma. Or leave blank if you never want to know what's going on in your site.



#### Twitter Settings

![](images/twitter-settings.jpg)

You can now choose to disable the Tweet This button on published items In enabled, you can enter one or more hashtags to be used when a published item is shared via the **Tweet This** button. Do not include "#" and separate multiple ones with commas

#### Estimated Reading Time Plugin
This plugin is optional, if installed and activated, it will add to all published works an estimate of the reading time based on a crude formula. If it is not installed, you will see the notes shown above. This plugin is available in the Wordpress repository, so it is an easy install.




#### Author Account Setup

To provide access to the media uploader, this site uses a Wordpress Authoring Role account that is logged into invisibly to your site visitors (for anyone logged in with an Editor or Administrator account, like you this account is not used.). So your site needs an active user with a name of **writer** and a role of **Author**.

![](images/add-author.jpg)

You can follow the link from the options page to create this account; for an email you can use a fictitious one on your domain; nothing is ever sent to it. We suggest using the strong password that Wordpress suggests. If this site is on a multi-site Wordpress, and the TRU Writer has been used on another site, the writer account already exists, so you need to add it to the site via the Author tools.  

** Note: As of version 0.3 of this theme, the password no longer needs to be copied and entered into the options screen.** If you are using a version of the theme that has a password field in the options, maybe it's a good time to update? Otherwise, [see an older version of this ReadMe](https://github.com/cogdog/truwriter/blob/50d86fdfe039aec4575a2eaa29c16ad3374d3596/README.md#author-account-setup) for instructions.

#### Creative Commons / Rights Settings

![](images/creative-commons.jpg)

Creative Commons licenses or other usage rights (including copyright) can be attached to all works published on your site. Choose **Apply one license to all challenges** to place the same license on all works (a notice will be displayed on the writing form).

Or you can set the option to **Enable users to choose license** which places the same menu on the writing form so users can choose a license (or set to All Rights Reserved).

## Customize the Write Form

You can  customize the field labels and the descriptions of the form where people submit new pieces of writing to a TRU Writer site. On your site navigate to the write form, and  activate the Wordpress Customizer from the admin bar. 

Look for a special section at the bottom to open:

![](images/customizer-writer-tab.jpg)

Then from this pane, open "Write Form" tab

![](images/customizer-writer-form-tab.jpg)

And then you will see a series of fields to edit for all form field elements. 

For each, you can edit the title/label of the field and the prompt that appears below. As you type in the customizer fields on the left, you will see a live preview on the right.

![](images/customizer-form-edit.jpg)

## Customize the Content Layout

You can  also customize the content layout. On your site navigate to any content post or page, and activate the Wordpress Customizer from the admin bar. From the **TRU Writer** pane, open **Writer Layout**. Here you can choose from the Thin or Medium layout widths (Wide will only affect very large screens).

![](images/customizer-layout.jpg)

## Some Complexish Stuff for Nerds, Who Are Awesome

If you want to customize/re-arrange the buttons and controls on the rich text editor used by writers on your site, install [TinyMCE Advanced](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-advanced/). There is [a file in the theme](includes/tinymce-advanced-settings.txt)  with the typical settings for this plugin I use when I set up these sites.

You can copy and paste from that .txt file into the import field of the settings for TinyMCE Advanced (it's a small chunk of json).

## Relatively Cool New Features & Updates

**Better Front End Editor**  Reduced reliance on special pages. The links to the random entry and the one use to get the edit link are no longer needed, and are handle now in the code. These pages should be deleted from your site. On an update to version 1.7 or later, you might have to go to **Settings** - **Permalinks** and just click save to update the url rules. Also the method for using the special link to edit an entry is now done in a single click. Much better!

**Better Front End Editor** Customizer options for choosing a this or wider content layout. URLs for media that [WordPress natively can oembed](https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds#Okay.2C_So_What_Sites_Can_I_Embed_From.3F) will now do so in the front end editor.

![](images/autoembed-splot-editor.gif)

Media can also be uploaded by dragging and dropping files onto the editing area. Inside the code the long `functions.php` is now broken up into more manageable size includes. Small display improvements on single item views. The licensing options updated to be driven by functions, and expanded to include public domain and yikes, even copyright.

**Under the Hood** Fixed bug where choosing no comments hid the Reading Time display, changed options editor for default content to be rich text editor, enabled drag and drop media uploading for front page writing form. Also, URLs that WordPress can autoembed (e.g. YouTube, Twitter, Giphy) will now do so automatically in the editor.

**Theme Option to Remove Tweet This Button** to enable better GDPR compliance.

**Customize the Writing Form Instructions**  You can now modify all form field labels and descriptions / prompts for the entry fields.

**Default Menu** On new installs where no menus are defined, the theme generates a simple menu rather than listing all pages 

**Reading Time Plugin** The [Estimated Reading Time Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/estimated-post-reading-time/) is no longer available, so the theme now uses [Reading Time WP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/reading-time-wp/).

**Separate CSS / Functions for Custom Installs** Fixed quote bug for captions, and changed writing form so it only displays featured image and intro text for first view of the form (so you can add really long instructions).

**Tweet This Button** There is a new option so you can have your own hashtags added when someone tweets a published item. Also, twitter card meta data has been added so these tweets have the extended card display that shows the featured image, the site's title, and an excerpt from the item-- example https://twitter.com/cogdog/status/822656183769198593

**Options Refreshed, Auto Page Creation, Better Reading Time Display** Recoded the theme options so documentation in its own tab. When he theme is activated now, the necessary pages will be created automagically. And if the Estimated reading time plugin is not activated, nothing will be displayed where it normally displays.

**Provide an Email, Edit your Work Later** A major limitation of the first versions was that authors had no ability to edit their work after publishing (that's what happens when you don't have logins). As of November 2015, authors have a new field where they can enter an email address- if this is provided (it is not required), they will receive via email a special coded URL they can use at anytime to modify their work.

When published, any writing with an email is published with a `Get Edit Link` button at the bottom which will resend the link to the email associated with it.

![](images/email-request.jpg "Email Request Link")

**Admins Can Get Edit Link for Anybody** Even if the author does not provide an email address, in the Wordpress Dashboard interface, editors and admins can click and copy an edit like they can provide directly to a writer (this is added as a side metabox).

![](images/re-edit-link.jpg "Admin Re-edit Link")
